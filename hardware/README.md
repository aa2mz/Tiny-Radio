# Hardware

A goal of the tiny radio software project is to develop code that doesn't
need to be modified to be used in your radio project.
The three hardware projects which all use the same unmodified tiny radio code
are given to help understand how this might be done,

The source files for the hardware are also given so that you may be able to
use the hardware as-is or modified to better suit your need.
