# tiny radio
A circuit board is added to the very tiny radio to add an encoder, buttons and diplay.
This implenents a radio panel that "local control" provided by the encooder and buttons
as remote contol over the USB cable. 
This implenetation is more robust on the bench and also contains addional controls and
plugs that will help development and testing.

For example, use one plug as a CW key input, a button for PTT and the potenitometer as a volume control.

Mounting holes match those of the Forty9er PCB board.

The reference PCB can be made at home. 
I use a mini-router but chemical etching should work as well.
