# tiny radio
A circuit board is added to the very tiny radio to add an encoder, buttons and diplay.
This implenents a radio panel that "local control" provided by the encooder and buttons
as remote contol over the USB cable. 
This implenetation is more robust on the bench and also contains addional controls and
plugs that will help development and testing.

For example, use one plug as a CW key input, a button for PTT and the potenitometer as a volume control.

Mounting holes match those of the Forty9er PCB board.

The reference PCB can be made at home. 
I use a mini-router but chemical etching should work as well.

Note that the traces in this implemenation are all on the top side of the board so
you may need to flip images if using transfer/chemical etching techniques.

The tiny radio (aka "easyVFO") project is shared on easyEDA web site. 
If you don't want to make your own board, all files can be found there
and PCBs can be ordered from that site. 
10x PCBs with shipping will cost about $18 USD so share them with your friends and club.
