I've a pretty simple mod to the Forty-9er kit that turns it into a double sideband digital transceiver.
But it also works as a standalone CW QRP rig. 
See section four "Hardware Mods"

To use as a digital transceiver, connect via USB to your computer and choose ic756Pro, ic7000 or Xeigu 5105 radio 
in your application's settings.

To use as a standalone QRP rig, you'll need to use your CW key to control the radio.
(It may also be possible to use your cell phone if your phone supports USB OTG.
See section three.)
