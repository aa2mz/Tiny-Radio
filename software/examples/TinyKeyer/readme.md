# Tiny Keyer

This is a test to show the workings of the keyer.

You will need to open a Serial Tool in Arduino IDE or some sort of terminal window to setup and control the keyer.

I don't make a "keyer app" because I don't use one and don't pretend to know what features are important. 
(Maybe you do and will modify the code and share?)
But the keyer does have many basic features:
- works well to 40+ WPM
- supports separate wpm and character rates. (Like Farnsworth.)
- preliminare support for "weight"
- can change all parameters via the serial (Or USB) port.
- text to CW support via the terminal connection.
- CW to text entered from the paddle keyer.
- support for straight key and paddle
- "straighter" key mode that correct dot timing but lets you lean on dashes.
- paddle can connect via two I/O or one Analog
- displays CW to Text is OLED is attached
