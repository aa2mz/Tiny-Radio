# Software

The software implements a control system for an HF radio transceiver. 

Radio features are controlled by digital lines going high or low to actvate transistors, ICs and relays 
that turn on and off radio circuits. 
Some features are also controlled by serial protocols such as I2C, SPI and other protocols.
In turn, ths software itself can be controlled by serial protocols received over USB or other connections.
